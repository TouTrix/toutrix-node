First, thanks for reading.

I'm Eric. 36 years old. I began this project because I always worked on project alone. I
also have so much ideas than I had to find the best way to realize all of them. And this
project came to life.

TouTrix is a fun project. We want to reuse all other codes to make a better world.

You will see, at first, new codes will be using Google technologies. Because we are hosted
their and we do not plan to move for the moment. It make sense to use Google because we can
focus on coding.

Project architecture

Coming soon.
