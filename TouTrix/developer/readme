..DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE FOR THE MOMENT..

First, thanks for reading.

I'm Eric. I began this project because I always worked on project alone. I
also have so much ideas than I had to find the best way to realize all of them. And this
project came to life.

TouTrix is a fun project. We want to reuse all other codes to make a better world.

You will see, at first, new codes will be using Google technologies. Because we are hosted
there and we do not plan to move for the moment. It make sense to use Google because we can
focus on coding.

This README is also some notes for myself to remember. Of course, we will need a documentation
structure. For the moment, I'm writing everything I can here.

Project architecture

services/ - This is where the magic begin. If we want to reuse any other module, we should
            add a service to configure the module. A service can use other service.
            

I'm coming soon with a first service as an example.


UI framework

I choosed ExtJS for the administrative panel. I hope my father will try to contribute to this project as
he his using ExtJS for his payroll application.
